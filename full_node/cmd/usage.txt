Instruction on Usage
1. Add Peers
$ add_peer PEER_IPV4 PEER_PORT
This command will add a mutual TCP connection between peer and current node. Adding a peer will start to receive network broadcast. Dead peer will be automatically pruned.

2. List Peers
$ list_peer
List all peers this fullnode has connection to.

3. Start Mining
$ start
Start mining at the tail of the chain, broadcast the mined block if successfully find a nounce without interruption.

4. Stop Mining
$ stop
Stop mining. Note that this node will still participate the consensus by validating and broadcasting blocks.

5. Restart Mining
$ restart
Restart the mining process at the new tail. In most cases you don't need to issue this command because mining will be restarted on tail change.

6. Show Blockchain
$ show NUMBER
Show the blocks in the last ${NUMBER} of layers. Listing all branched. Note that, you'll need to install graphviz to actually see the rendered blockchain.

7. Sync Blockchain
$ sync
Mostly likely you won't need this command. Your node will sync with others once it received invalid blocks multiple times. But you can proactively issue this command to sync.

8. Show Public Key in Hex
$ key
Show public key in hex string, share to others to receive transaction.
